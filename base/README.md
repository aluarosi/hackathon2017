This folder contains the source code and additional files that Valo and Globalcode prepared in advance for the Hackathon @ J On The Beach 2017. This is about examples and mini-libraries that the participants had available to use for learning, gettting inspiration and build upon.

No code written by the participants should be in this directory.
