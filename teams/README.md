Each team should create a folder under `teams/`, named following this format: `team-<team_name>-info` (e.g. `teams/team-a`).

Under that folder, the team will create a file that contains the following information at least:  


```
Team name: ...
Team members: ...
Link to slides/presentation assets: ...
Use case description:
...
...
``` 

A PR is expected from this `team-<team_name>-info` branch to the master one, so that we can track all the projects and teams info.
